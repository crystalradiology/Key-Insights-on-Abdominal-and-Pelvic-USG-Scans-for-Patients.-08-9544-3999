At Butler Medical Imaging, we believe in empowering our patients through education and access to the latest diagnostic technology. Among the most commonly used and valuable tools in medical imaging today is the Abdominal and Pelvic USG Scans service. These ultrasound scans are non-invasive, highly effective, and offer real-time insight into your body’s internal organs.
Whether you’re dealing with unexplained abdominal pain, undergoing pregnancy monitoring, or being evaluated for a specific condition, understanding how abdominal and pelvic ultrasounds work can help you feel more confident and informed during the diagnostic process.
What Are Abdominal and Pelvic USG Scans?
Ultrasound (USG) scans use high-frequency sound waves to generate live images of the body’s internal organs and tissues. Unlike X-rays or CT scans, ultrasound does not use radiation, making it one of the safest imaging techniques for people of all ages—including pregnant women and children.
Our Abdominal and Pelvic USG Scans service is specifically designed to assess key organs such as the liver, kidneys, bladder, gallbladder, spleen, pancreas, uterus, ovaries, and prostate. These scans are essential for both routine screenings and urgent investigations into symptoms like persistent pain or swelling.
Why Are Abdominal and Pelvic USG Scans Needed?
The Abdominal and Pelvic USG Scans service at Butler Medical Imaging serves a broad range of medical purposes, including:
1. Diagnosis of Medical Conditions
Ultrasound scans help in detecting:
•	Gallstones and kidney stones
•	Liver and pancreatic diseases
•	Tumours, cysts, or masses in the abdomen or pelvic region
•	Fluid collections or abscesses
2. Symptom Evaluation
If you’re experiencing symptoms like:
•	Abdominal pain or discomfort
•	Unexplained bloating or swelling
•	Irregular bowel movements or urinary issues
3. Women’s Health and Pregnancy
Ultrasound is a cornerstone of gynecological and obstetric care. It can:
•	Evaluate ovarian cysts, uterine fibroids, and endometriosis.
•	Monitor pregnancy progress and assess fetal development.
•	Check for complications such as ectopic pregnancy or miscarriage.
4. Guidance for Procedures
Ultrasound guidance is often used during:
•	Drainage of fluid collections
•	Biopsies of abdominal or pelvic masses
•	Placement of catheters or other instruments
•	Our Abdominal and Pelvic USG Scans service is not only diagnostic—it also plays a supporting role in many minor medical interventions.
Types of Ultrasound Scans Used
There are several techniques used during abdominal and pelvic ultrasound exams, including:
1.	Transabdominal Ultrasound: A probe is moved across the surface of the abdomen to capture images.
2.	Transvaginal Ultrasound: A thin probe is inserted into the vagina to closely examine female reproductive organs.
3.	Transrectal Ultrasound: Used primarily in men to assess the prostate and surrounding structures.
Each technique is chosen based on your symptoms and the area being assessed. Regardless of the type, our Abdominal and Pelvic USG Scans service is comfortable, fast, and performed by highly trained sonographers.
How to Prepare for Your Scan
Proper preparation can help ensure accurate results. For abdominal scans, fasting for 6–8 hours may be required to reduce gas in the intestines that can interfere with imaging. For pelvic scans, a full bladder is often necessary to create a better window for imaging.
When you book your Abdominal and Pelvic USG Scans service with Butler Medical Imaging, we’ll provide specific preparation instructions tailored to your scan.
